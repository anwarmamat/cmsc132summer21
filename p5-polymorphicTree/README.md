# Project 5: Polymorphic Trees

## Due Date: July 21st 2021

# Overview

You will be completeing recursive tree functions which are based on a polymorhpic tree class. You will be doing error handling, recursion, polymorphism.

## Things to know
The classes `PolymorphicBST` and interface `Tree` describe the behavior of individual methods that need to be implemented. Certain methods have been left implemented as an example for you to see code that conforms to the restrictions.

# Design

Notice that the insert and delete methods on `Tree` objects return references to `Tree` objects. In many cases, these functions may return a reference to the this object. However, in some cases they can't. For example. `EmptyTree.getInstance.insert("a", "1")` has to return an instance of an `NonEmptyTree` object.

# Specification

You only need to modify `EmptyTree`, `NonEmptyTree`, and `PlaceKeysValuesInArrayLists`. **You may not add any classes**.

# Implementation Restrictions

-    You may not use any form of looping construct.
 -    You may not use any arrays.
 -   You may not explicitly check a `Tree` to see whether it is an `EmptyTree` or `NonEmptyTree`.
 -    Your `EmptyTree` and `NonEmptyTree` implementations may not have any comparisons against the null value.
 -   You should not need to do any casting for this project. If you are casting, you are probably not using generic programming correctly.
  -   If you insert multiple values with the same key, only the value associated with the most recent insertion will be saved.
  -   You may not use any classes from `java.util` except `ArrayList`, `Set` and `HashSet`.
  -   You may not add any public methods.
  -   You may not check whether a tree is empty by using comparisons similar to the following:
        - `left == EmptyTree.getInstance()`
        - `tree.size() == 0`
        - Other comparisons similar to the above

- You are expected to use polymorphism (and exception handling, where appropriate) to handle the differences between empty and nonempty trees. Failure to do so will result in a large negative adjustment to your project grade.
- You may not use `Collections.sort` for this project.
- You may not use `instanceof`.
- You may not use `getClass()`.
- The delete method must use the approach described in the lecture slides. You may not implement delete by creating a new tree and inserting all the keys from the source tree except the one you want to delete.
- For the Subtree method you may not create an empty tree and traverse the whole tree inserting only those entries within the specified range. If a simple check will tell you that an entire subtree can be excluded, your implementation should not traverse that subtree.

The above restrictions do not apply to your test cases; you may write them however you wish. 

# Grading
* Public Tests (15%)
* Release Tests (42%)
* Secret Tests (33%)
* Style (10%)

# Project Policies
* See [Style Guidelines](http://www.cs.umd.edu/class/summer2017/cmsc132/resources/StyleGuidelines.html) for information regarding style.
* We cannot provide any information regarding release and secret tests. Once your project has been graded, you can see a TA if you would like to find out why you failed a release or secret test.

# Testing
It is recommended that you test your own code using student tests.

# Submission
To submit your project, zip the project folder and upload the zipped file to gradescope.

# Academic Integrity
Please make sure you read the academic integrity section of the syllabus so you understand what is permissible in our programming projects. We want to remind you that we check your project against other students' projects and any case of academic dishonesty will be referred to the Office of Student Conduct.

A finely tempered nature longs to escape from the personal life into the world of objective perception and thought."
    "He who joyfully marches to music rank and file, has already earned my contempt. He has been given a large brain by mistake, since for him the spinal cord would surely suffice. This disgrace to civilization should be done away with at once.

It is my conviction that killing under the cloak of war is nothing but an act of murder."

Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty."
